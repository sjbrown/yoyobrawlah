events.py
---------
This is a weird module and uses difficult to read code to make an event
broker with the minimum of typing.  Basically whenever an event is created,
it is automatically broadcast using the module-level function, EventFired()

Note: this is much less sophisticated than an EventManager (as in sjbeasts
and my tutorial).  In particular, it suffers from the ABC->ACB event "out of
order" phenomenon and doesn't use weakrefs, so it keeps all listeners
unessecarily alive.

It's only advantage is that it saves me some typing.
